Introduction: In this assignment, you will build a microservices-based system that manages a simple e-commerce application. The system should handle user authentication, product management, and order processing. Emphasis will be placed on implementing concurrency control and ensuring the system can handle clustering for high availability.

Requirements:

Microservices Architecture:

Design a microservices architecture for the system, breaking it down into services for user authentication, product management, and order processing.
Use a technology stack suitable for building and managing microservices (e.g., Spring Boot, Node.js with Express, Flask, etc.).
Concurrency Control:

Implement concurrent access control for the product management service. Ensure that multiple users can safely read and update product information without conflicts.
Choose a suitable method for managing concurrent access (e.g., optimistic locking, pessimistic locking, or another approach).
Clustering and High Availability:

Set up a clustering mechanism for your microservices to ensure high availability. Use a technology or framework suitable for your chosen programming language.
Deploy the system on multiple nodes or containers, and demonstrate that the system remains available even if one node/container goes down.
Database Integration:

Utilize a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) for storing user information, product data, and order history. Design the database schema for these entities.
Implement database connections and appropriate queries within your microservices.
APIs and Communication:

Develop RESTful APIs for each microservice, allowing them to communicate with each other.
Implement endpoints for user registration, product CRUD, and order management.
Ensure that microservices can make synchronous or asynchronous calls to other microservices as needed.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication and authorization for accessing protected endpoints.
Ensure that users can only access their own orders and the products they are authorized to view/update.
